The Offbrand library is a collection of reference counted generic data 
structures with hooks for thread synchronization implemented in the C 
programming language. The library includes bash scripts to assist in the
creation and testing of classes compatible with the framework.

Requirements:
-------------
The Offbrand library requires the GCC compiler, make, and GNU C libraries 
(glibc) including pthreads.

Windows is currently unsupported.

Documentaion:
-------------
All external documentation can be found in the doc/ subdirectory. "doc/info.txt"
provides an outline of the library and gives insight into its design. The best
source for information on standard libraries and classes are the relevant header
files ("include/offbrand.h" and "include/offbrand_threaded.h" contain 
information on the standard libraries and threaded libraries respectivly).
Comments in these files are intended to provide all of the information required
to effectively use the objects and APIs.
